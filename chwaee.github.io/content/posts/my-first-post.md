# Hello World

Hello! Please visit my About page if you'd like to get more information on me, but the TLDR is that I'm a computer generalist.  I've worked in support, pro-serv, QA, DevOps, CloudOps and development roles.  I'm here to start sharing my experiences, and hopefully make this a better world.  Positivity is always at the front of my mind, unless you get me started on tangents of tech debt, or spell my name incorrectly in an email.  

Over my years in the industry, I've seen a lot of tech debt, and places that could be improved upon.  Sometimes it's as simple as needing a quick reference and/or tutorial guide to get a coworker up and running quickly.  Other times issues can be so ingrained in a product that a complete code rewrite is required, like when web browsers deprecated Flash, and your product was relying on it.  

I don't really have a current goal for this blog.  I envision that it'll be a combination of tutorials, reference docs, tangents, rants, discussion posts, and news updates.  If you like what you see, feel free to bookmark the site and check back for more posts!

Cheers,
Chwaee
